# goodStart
Good Start is designed for the user that likes to set and achieve their goals. 
It is for the users to slow down and start their day with an inspirational quote to reflect on.

I wanted to keep the site simple, with just 2 main pages. I used event handlers to display the quote page and re-display the home page, rather than creating 2 html files for different pages. Although in hindsight, this might have been simpler. 

Keyframes were used to create the looping CSS animation. The glowing/growing circle was inspired by artists such as James Turrell and Olafur Eliasson, who both work with colour and light.
